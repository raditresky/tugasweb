        <p>The Desert Scourge is a large, dry, spiked serpent fought in the Desert biome. It is summoned with a Desert Medallion in the Desert, and does not spawn naturally. While it is intended to be one of the first bosses fought and has a relatively simple AI, its intimidating size and speed can easily overwhelm an unprepared player. It becomes a greater threat in Revengeance Mode, where two extra minions known as Desert Nuisances join in the fight, and the scourge is able to fire a barrage of sand bolts from its segments.
        The Desert Scourge drops weapons themed around water and electricity, as well as many Pearl Shards, an early game crafting material. It also drops many Angler quest rewards such as the Weather Radio or the Angler Earring. Additionally, it allows blocks in the Sunken Sea to be mined and enables Sandstorms.</p>

        <p>The Hive Mind is a large, brain-like amalgamation fought in The Corruption. It is summoned by using a Teratoma in The Corruption or by killing a Hive Tumor. For its first phase it is immobile, teleporting from time to time, instead relying on its many corrupt minions to attack the player. After losing 25% of its health, it transitions into its second phase, fully healed and no longer bound to the ground. It now rushes and teleports towards the player, performing special dash attacks while continuing to summon its servants.
        The Hive Mind drops weapons themed around corruption and the dark, as well as Rotten Matter, which can be used to craft its drops and other items. After defeating it for the first time, Aerialite Ore will generate in Space.</p>

        The Perforators drop weapons themed around flesh and blood, as well as Blood Samples, which can be used to craft their drops and other items. After they have been defeated for the first time, Aerialite Ore will generate in Space.</p>

        The Slime God itself will fly around very quickly, attempting to charge at the player while leaving most of the fighting to its Ebonian and Crimulan Paladin bodyguards. These slimes will perform great jumps towards the player while firing lingering mines, orbs and summoning their own minions. When they reach half health, they will split into smaller, weaker slime gods that will continue to attack. The Slime Gods will get stronger depending on which one is killed first.
        The Slime God drops weapons themed around slime, The Corruption, and The Crimson, as well as Purified Gel, which can be used to craft its drops and several late Pre-Hardmode items.</p>

It periodically vomits bursts of many projectiles, from sulphuric water and gas clouds to homing teeth.

She has three different methods of attack which she switches between randomly: teleporting around and leaving behind harmless brimstone eruptions, hovering frantically above the player while shooting fireballs and darts, and encasing herself in highly defensive rose petals while firing blasts of projectiles. She also summons minions called Brimlings that shoot gravity affected brimstone fireballs and follow a similar movement pattern to the Brimstone Elemental's first phase.

        Calamitas Clone behaves much like Retinazer, hovering around the player and firing lasers at them, though her lasers will burst into three fast, homing versions after a short time. Upon reaching 75% of her health, she enrages and begins shooting fireballs. Throughout the fight she summons her brothers Catastrophic Construct and Cataclysmic Construct. The brothers will spit fireballs and spew a flamethrower, respectively, and charge toward the player. Calamitas Clone also spawns a ring of Soul Seekers around her and swarms of Life Seekers at half health.

The Leviathan will appear when Anahita reaches 40% health. Although intended to be fought after defeating Plantera, they can be summoned at any point in the game.
        Anahita will periodically generate an ice shield to protect herself, while attacking the player with a variety of projectiles. The Leviathan will spend most of her time at the player's side, repeatedly launching meteors and summoning minions, while occasionally charging into the player. If either of them are defeated, the boss left alive will become enraged, increasing the aggressiveness of their attacks.

It behaves similarly to the Golem, attempting to jump onto the player and slam back down on them and hit them with its claws. When its claws and feet are destroyed, sparks and fireballs will be shot from the empty sockets. It will also summon large stone pillars, fire-throwing pillars, homing missiles and, after its head is destroyed, bursts of lasers and white bolts in every direction. Each of its five body parts must be destroyed before the body itself can be damaged.
        The Ravager drops flesh and bone themed weapons and two powerful accessories: The Flesh Totem, which cuts enemy contact damage in half every 15 seconds, and the Blood Pact, which doubles the player's maximum health, but allows them to be critically hit at a 25% chance. The Ravager also drops all ingredients to the Core of Calamity and also all the ingredients to the Life Alloy.
        After Providence is defeated, all of its stats are buffed, its health raises to 708,325 (947,625 Expert Mode in Expert Mode, and 1,034,025 Revengeance Mode in Revengeance Mode) total, and it begins dropping Bloodstone. It also begins dropping the Bloodflare Core accessory, which grants benefits based on your current health and defense.

        <p>Supreme Witch, Calamitas is an incredibly powerful brimstone witch. Alongside Draedon and the Exo Mechs, she is the final boss of the Calamity Mod, excluding hidden bosses. She is summoned at an Altar of the Accursed at any time with Ashes of Calamity or Ceremonial Urn in the player's inventory. Calamitas' attacks are primarily enormous waves or floods of projectiles which are very difficult to dodge, which become more chaotic and introduce more elements as the fight progresses. She also summons servants to aid her, such as her brothers, Soul Seekers, and Sepulcher.
        She drops royal items themed around hatred and the occult, as well as the Ashes of Annihilation crafting material, which are used alongside Exo Prisms to craft Shadowspec Bars, the final crafting material.
        After her defeat, Calamitas will also spawn as the Brimstone Witch town NPC, allowing the player to utilize the Enchantment system to significantly modify or even transform their items.
